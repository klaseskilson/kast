> :notes: The missing podcast app

## Getting started

This is a `Meteor 1.3` app. First, you need to [install Meteor](https://meteor.com/install). 
When you've done that, copy the contents of [`settings.example.json`](settings.example.json) to
`settings.json`, and enter the empty fields in that file. This file contains client IDs and secrets
to the external services used in the app. Then run

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

to install dependencies and start the app. Then head over to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
